# Multilingual-Toxicity-Detection

Aalto SNLP Course Competition
2025

The task of our project is Multilingual Toxicity Detection, where the goal is to develop
text-based models that classify short texts as toxic or non-toxic. The key challenge for the
task is the generalization of cross-linguals between English, German, and Finnish, as the
training dataset only contains English. In contrast, the development and test dataset contains
German and Finnish.

Therefore, the main goal of the project will be then:

• Choose, apply, and compare tokenization and embedding methods that effectively
generalize to English, German, and Finnish.

• Train and evaluate both custom and pretrained models for toxicity classification, and
compare their effectiveness.

• Explore additional techniques to enhance classification performance for the competi-
tion.
